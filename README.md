Nodejs mentorship programme


I would like to join the program so as to have an experience in real-time projects and put what I have learnt into practice.I believe in mentorship as it has spurns one into what they want to because they learn from people who already have experience.I know the program will have a huge toll in shaping my career as a backend developer.I wish to learn a lot from my mentors and be more confident in doing nodejs projects.
